For any legal trouble, related to the content shown in this website, must be addressed with the owners of the servers that are storing this content, as we are not affilliated nor colaborating with them.

### Prerequisites

We are using the [**Aruppi Api**](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api) so make you sure to download and setup
the api aswell-


### Contribution 

1. Fork it!
2. Create a branch for the feature you want to make: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`

4. Push to the branch: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`

**Note** both the angular and the android projects have environment variables to connect to your local Aruppi Api server. For default
the android app will connect to your local server only if you are running it on an emulator, if you want to test on a real device, change the variable
in the gradle file, but please donÂ´t commit this change.
