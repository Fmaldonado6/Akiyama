<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Akiyama is an open source website and android app to watch anime using the unofficial [AnimeFLV API](https://github.com/Jeluchu/animeflv), developed with the objective of learning and improving my coding skills

All the content that can be found in this application is hosted in third party servers such as Mega, YourUpload, FEMBED, etc. All this services are available for free online. For any legal trouble, related to the content shown in this website, must be addressed with the owners of the servers that are storing this content, as we are not affilliated nor colaborating with them.

### Built With

Web App:

- Angular
- Angular Material

Android App:

- Kotlin
- MVVM architecture

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Before cloning the repo make sure you have installed

- [**NODE**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+node) (version >= 12.17.x)
- [**NPM**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+npm) (version >= 6.14.x)
- [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Starting a local development server

- Once you have forked or downloaded the project, go into de server directory and install the server dependencies with

```
  npm install
```

- Then you can start the server with

```
  npm run build && npm run start
```

## Note

- By default the android project is configured to run in an emulator, so the API url is 10.0.2.2:4000 which is the equivalent to localhost:4000, if you want to debug the app in a physical device make sure to look inside the file mobile_app/app/build.gradle, then look into the buildTypes and change the url in buildConfigField inside debug to your local ip address.

## Contribution

1. Fork it!
2. Create a branch for the feature you want to make: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request

**Note** both the angular and the android projects have environment variables to connect to your local Aruppi Api server. For default
the android app will connect to your local server only if you are running it on an emulator, if you want to test on a real device, change the variable
in the gradle file, but please donÂ´t commit this change.

## Deprecated v1 for API
Aruppi has grown since it was launched and we need to continue improving the application along with the services to be able to give new features.

But if you need to see the code or the operation of the old version you can do it

- [Aruppi API GitHub (v1) [Deprecated]](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api-v1)
- [Aruppi API Custom Link(v1) [Deprecated]](https://aruppi.herokuapp.com/api/Aruppi/)

## Countdown to deprecation of v2 API

Aruppi has grown since it was launched and we need to continue improving the application along with the services to be able to give new features.

At this time version 2.6.8 will remain functional until Aruppi App users fully migrate to version 1.5.0 of the app
